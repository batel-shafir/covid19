## COVID-19 APP 
Simple App that uses https://covid19api.com/ API and returns the 10 countries with highest amount of confirmed cases in the past 3 months.

In this project I used the following technologies: 
React hooks, axios and Material UI.



In the project directory, run:

### `npm i`
Installs all the node modules for the required project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
